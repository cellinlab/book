A `tablespace` is a logical storage container for segments. Segments are database objects, such as tables and indexes, that consume storage space.  
A `segment` is a set of extents allocated for a specific database object, such as a table. Each segment belongs to one and only one tablespace.  
An `extent` is a set of logically contiguous data blocks allocated for storing a specific type of information.  
One `logical data block` corresponds to a specific number of bytes of physical disk space, for example, 2 KB.

    ORGANIZATION INDEX -- index-organized table. 

ORGANIZATION: the order in which the data rows of the table are stored.
- HEAP: the data rows of table are stored in no particular order. This is the *default*.
- INDEX: table is created as an index-organized table. In an index-organized table, the data rows are held in an index defined on the primary key for the table.
- EXTERNAL: table is a read-only table located outside the database.

    NOCOMPRESS -- whether to compress data segments to reduce disk use
    PCTFREE 10 -- NOCOMPRESS use the PCTFREE default value of 10, to maximize compress while still allowing for some future DML changes to the data
    INITRANS 2 -- Specify the initial number of concurrent transaction entries allocated within each data block allocated to the database object.
    MAXTRANS 255 --  deprecated.
    LOGGING -- a database object will be logged in the redo log file
