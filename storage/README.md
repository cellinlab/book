# Ceph - C++
Ceph uniquely delivers object, block, and file storage in one unified system.  
A Ceph Storage Cluster consists of two types of daemons:
* Ceph Monitor: maintains a master copy of the cluster map
* Ceph OSD Daemon: checks its own state and the state of other OSDs and reports back to monitors.
